# TrafficPredictAlgorithms

In the second year of my bachelor study Artificial Intelligence we received the task to solve our own data problem for the course Data Mining. My partner and I decided to try to predict traffic on a specific day based on the weather and the date of that day. We implemented 4 different algorithms: multiple linear regression, random forest, support vector regression and xgboost. The hyperparameter tuning and testing was done using nested cross validation. The random forest algorithm had the lowest root mean squared error, and we thus concluded it performed the best.
